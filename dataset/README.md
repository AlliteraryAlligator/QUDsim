# QUDsim Dataset

The contents of ```qud_data.json``` holds the dataset that we built and ran experiments and analyses on and ```annotations.json``` contains the human annotations we collected during intrinsic evaluation. To access fields in the dataframes, you can refer to the ```DatasetColumns``` class in ```/schema.py```. 


| Field | Description |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Source/Target Prompt | The prompt used for generating the documents. |
| Source/Target Domain | One of three domains the document is a type of. |
| Pair Type | Type of document-pair comparison: <br> ```IN_DOMAIN```: documents generated by different models, given the same prompt <br> ```MINIMAL_PAIR```: documents generated by the same model, but given different prompts. |
| Labeler | Describes what/who answered the QUDs. In ```annotations.json```, we provide the raw data collected by individual annotators as well as the intersection of answers found between annotators, which can be differentiated using this field. |
| Level | The extent of abstraction when generating QUDs. This determines whether or not entity abstraction is performed on segments before generating QUDs. |
| Model | The model that generated the document (there are also human-generated documents) |
| Source/Target Text | Raw responses collected from models/humans. |
| Source/Target Numbered Text | Sentence-tokenized and numbered responses. |
| Source/Target Number to Sentence | A dictionary that maps the sentence number to the sentence. |
| Source/Target Segments | A list where the  $i^{th}$ element describes the sentences in the  $i^{th}$ segment in the given document. |
| Source/Target QUDs | A list of dictionaries where the $i^{th}$ dictionary represents the list of QUDs generated for the $i^{th}$ segment. |
| Source/Target QUD to Segment | A dictionary that maps the QUD index to the segment index that generated it for a given document. |
| Source/Target Segment to QUD | A dictionary that maps a segment index to the list of QUD indices that it generated for a given document. |
| QUD Answers | Answers to the source QUDs given the target text. |
| QUD Answer Segments | A list where the $i^{th}$ element is a list of segment indices in the target text that answer the $i^{th}$ source QUD. |
